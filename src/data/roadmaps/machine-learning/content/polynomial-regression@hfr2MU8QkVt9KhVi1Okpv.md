# Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used when the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is non-linear. Instead of fitting a straight line, polynomial regression fits a curve to the data by using polynomial features (e.g., x, x², x³, etc.) as predictors. This allows the model to capture more complex relationships and potentially provide a better fit to the data compared to simple linear regression when the underlying relationship is curved.
